<h1>Welcome to Aaron Smith's Personal Portfolio Web Site!</h1>
  
<img src="20240121_230130.jpg">
  <pre>
    This is a drawing representing inequity in the justice system.
    The victim has been sentenced to life for a crime he did not commit.
    He longs for the things others take for granted.
    Sometimes, life is just unfair.
  </pre>
<img src="Logo Solution.png">
  <pre>
    A logo for my Graphic Design class.
    This was originally going to be purple, but I realized orange would fit better.
  </pre>
<img src="Project 1 - Concepts & Sketches.jpg">
  <pre>
    These are the sketches I drew before deciding on the one used above.
  </pre>
<img src="Smith Final Digital Logo 2.png">
  <pre>
    This is the final version of my personal logo.
    Basically, it's a keyboard company and arrow keys are recognized by all gamers, so I ended up with that design.
  </pre>
<img src="Smith Digital Logo.png">
  <pre>
    This is the first version of my personal logo.
    I ended up removing the black outlines since they were too sloppy.
  </pre>
<img src="20231130_092505.jpg">
  <pre>
    This is a ant's eye view of the dumpster from my work. 
    It's in HDR, and is one of my two HDR projects in this portfolio.</pre>
<img src="Smith Project 6 - HDR Project.jpg">
  <pre>
    This is my other HDR project. 
    It depicts a view of the outside world from the inside of a barn.
    Personally I love the lighting the HDR gives, it makes it look like it was in a dream.
  </pre>
<img src="Week 2 Art Activity Expressionism.png">
  <pre>
    This was a face I painted for my Art History class,
    intended to mimic the art from the Expressionism era (which was a modernist movement).
    Did you know this emoji -> ðŸ˜± came from the expressionism era painting The Scream by Edvard Munch?
  </pre>
<img src="Week 3 Art Activity Dream Draw.png">
  <pre>
    This was a really abstract painting depicting a cashier at work. 
    I was dreaming about my work and when painting, was the first thing that came to my mind.
  </pre>
<img src="business card.png">
  <pre>
    This was a business card from one of my Graphic Design courses a few years ago.
    It's simple enough to get the point across.
    I don't think the gradient looks very good.
  </pre>
<img src="lamp.png">
  <pre>
    This is a lamp drawing I drew in order to get used to Adobe Illustrator.
  </pre>
<img src="updated logo comp small.png">
<pre>
  This was my final logo for Candle Soda, a fictitious soda company who was in need of an updated logo.
</pre>
